# annugrow
AnnuGrow simulates the production of aboveground plant biomass considering in detail the vertical movement of water (infiltration, transpiration, percolation) and to a limited extent evaporation from the soil. Competition among seeds and individuals are considered. Current parameterization is for grasslands, soil, and climate in Israel. The model (V2.6) and its application are described in KÃ¶chy (2008) BMC Ecology 8:4, doi:10.1186/1472-6785-8-4

# Versions
